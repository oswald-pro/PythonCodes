# Here's a simple example of how you can output a string in a "typing" way using Python

import time


def type_string(string):
    for character in string:
        print(character, end='', flush=True)
        time.sleep(0.05)


type_string("""
This code will prompt the user to enter the name of an image file, read the image file, and 
then display it in a window with the title 'Image'. The waitKey function will pause the  
program until a key is pressed, and the destroyAllWindows function will close the window 
when the program is finished.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.""")
